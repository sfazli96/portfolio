## Django forms are very similar to models.
## Youâ€™ll also notice an argument widget has been passed to both the fields. The author field has the forms.TextInput widget. This tells Django to load this field as an HTML text input element in the templates

from django import forms

class CommentForm(forms.Form):
    author = forms.CharField(
        max_length=60,
        widget=forms.TextInput(attrs={
            "class": "form-control",
            "placeholder": "Your Name"
        })
    )
    body = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea(
        attrs={
            "class": "form-control",
            "placeholder": "Leave a comment!"
        })
    )
