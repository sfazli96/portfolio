<!-- On line 7, we have the post title, which is a hyperlink. The link is a Django link where we are pointing to the URL named blog_detail, which takes an integer as its argument and should correspond to the pk value of the post.

Underneath the title, weâ€™ll display the created_on attribute of the post as well as its categories. On line 11, we use another for loop to loop over all the categories assigned to the post.

On line 17, we use a template filter slice to cut off the post body at 400 characters so that the blog index is more readable. -->
