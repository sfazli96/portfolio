## On line 9, the DateTimeField takes an argument auto_now_add=True. This assigns the current date and time to this field whenever an instance of this class is created.
## On line 10, the DateTimeField takes an argument auto_now=True. This assigns the current date and time to this field whenever an instance of this class is saved. 
## That means whenever you edit an instance of this class, the date_modified is updated.
## On line 20, we use another relational field, the ForeignKey field. This is similar to the ManyToManyField but instead defines a many to one relationship. 
## The reasoning behind this is that many comments can be assigned to one post. But you canâ€™t have a comment that corresponds to many posts.
